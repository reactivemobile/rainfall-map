# Rainfall Data

This application to download and display rainfall data from the [The Environment Agency](https://www.api.gov.uk/ea/rainfall/#rainfall)

> The Environment Agency has approximately 1000 real-time rain gauges which are connected by telemetry. Measurements of the amount of precipitation (mm) are captured in Tipping Bucket Raingauges (TBR). The data reported here gives accumulated totals for each 15 min period. The data is typically transferred once or twice per day.

**this uses Environment Agency rainfall data from the real-time data API (Beta)**
